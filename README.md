# Data Structures and Algorithms in C#

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms in C# to help learn and understand the foundational concepts in computer science. The purpose of this repository is to provide clean, understandable code that demonstrates the functionality of various data structures and algorithms.

## Contents

### Data Structures:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Heaps (Min/Max Heaps)
- Graphs

### Algorithms:
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.)
- Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/M-Orxan/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
3. Browse the `DataStructures` and `Algorithms` directories to explore the individual implementations.
